 * Testcase Example:  '["0E00","E0WE","0E00"]'
 *
 * Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0'
 * (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.
 * The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted
 * point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.
 * ‚Å†Note that you can only put the bomb at an empty cell. 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * For the given grid
 * 
 * 0 E 0 0
 * E 0 W E
 * 0 E 0 0
 * 
 * return 3. (Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies)
