 * Have you thought about this?
 * 
 * Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if
 * you have already thought through this!
 * 
 * If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such
 * as 10, 100.
 * 
 * Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is
 * a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you
 * handle such cases?
 * 
 * For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when
 * the reversed integer overflows.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should
 * return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
