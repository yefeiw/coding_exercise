 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,1,1,0,1]'
 *
 *
 * Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this
 * array if you can flip at most one 0.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [1,0,1,1,0]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the the maximum number of
 * consecutive 1s.
 * ‚Å†   After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
 * The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed
 * 10,000
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? In other
 * words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large
 * to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?
