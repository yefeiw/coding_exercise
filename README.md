# coding_exercise
Contains day-to-day coding exercise to practice overall coding skills.

## Background
I was never working so hard in my early twenties, until someday, when the layoff storm sweeps my company, albeit survived, I found myself unable to secure any better jobs if I stay the way I was. I admit that I started working hard late. But I do believe in one thing:

Better late than never.

The answers to many coding exercies on [LeetCode](http://www.leetcode.com) is avilable here. I might plan to write a gitbook based on my own understanding sometimes, but probably not soon.

I am trying to work on the company tabs, to prove that I doprepare myself for the job, and also for better programming skills. If you happened to be seeking jobs in a similar field. Feel free to comment on the code or ask questions. If I help you improve, I help myself improve.
