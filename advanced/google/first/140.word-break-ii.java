 *
 * 
 * Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of
 * non-empty words, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is
 * a valid dictionary word. You may assume the dictionary does not contain
 * duplicate words.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Return all such possible sentences.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example, given
 * s = "catsanddog",
 * dict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * A solution is ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * UPDATE (2017/1/4):
 * The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a
 * set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest
 * changes.
